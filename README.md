# CSVFileCombination

This project is to combine the contents of several CSV files into one. Users can select the folder where the CSV files are located with an unlimited number of files. However, Column A of the second or onwards imported files will be abandoned and Cell B1 of each file will be renamed as the respective filename.

Assuming that each file contains two columns only, while the first column of each file is the same.
