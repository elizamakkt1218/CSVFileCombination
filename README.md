# CSVFileCombination

This project is to combine the contents of several CSV files into one. Users can select the folder where the CSV files are located with an unlimited number of files. However, Column A of the second or onwards imported files will be abandoned and Row 1, Column B of each file will be renamed as the respective filename.
